# jsplaylist-mod

This mod of [Br3tt](http://br3tt.deviantart.com/)'s excellent [JSplaylist](http://br3tt.deviantart.com/art/JSPlaylist-509803158) adds support for using Edit menu Undo & Redo commands after
adding/removing/reordering playlist items. CTRL+z and CTRL+y keyboard shortcuts are supported.

It requires my modded version of WSH Panel mod. Only version 1.5.10 will work.
